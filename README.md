# ChromoPainter_AncientDNA


In the paper named "[Ancient Rome: A genetic crossroads of Europe andthe Mediterranean](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6466/708)", the authors used the ChromoPainter on ancient individuals to calculate haplotype sharing between ancient Italian individuals and present-day
population, and to reveal fine population genetic structure.

Here, I am trying to repeat their ChromoPainter analysis, and we can use this method to do similar analysis on ancient DNA in the future.
